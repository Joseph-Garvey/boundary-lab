# Boundary Lab

<img src="assets/mainwindow.png" alt="Script Editor" width="500">

Boundary Lab is a GUI-based Boundary Element Method (BEM) tool for loudspeaker design. It uses Ath to generate loudspeaker surface meshes, runs BEM solves, and shows SPL, directivity, radiation impedance, spinorama-style curves, and 3D balloon plots inside the desktop application.

## Features

- [Ath4](https://at-horns.eu/) `.cfg` editor with one-click geometry generation
- 3D mesh viewport for generated Ath meshes and imported `.msh` files
- Multi-mesh and multi-radiator BEM solves
- Source controls for level, polarity, delay, and HPF/LPF crossover shaping
- Live horizontal/vertical directivity, on-axis response, spinorama, and impedance plots
- dB/phase exporting into .txt files
- 3D balloon plot viewer with spherical sampling
- Project save/load with readable `.blab.json` files

## Base Requirements

- Windows 10/11 64-bit / Linux / MacOS
- Python 3.11 or newer
- Wine is required if using Ath to generate meshes


While not required, if modeling in Autodesk Fusion, the [Fusion2Msh](https://github.com/JWSound/fusiontomsh) add-in is strongly recommended for quick imports of models into Boundary Lab.

## Solver Requirements

Boundary Lab currently has 3 selectable BEM solver backends in the application preferences menu. Solve speed is dependant on hardware GPU-based solving is generally the fastest option with 20-30x speed gains over CPU-based solving with typical hardware.

### BEAT Engine CUDA GPU Solver Requirements

* NVIDIA Maxwell-generation or newer GPU
* Latest NVIDIA Studio/Game Ready driver recommended
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/) installed and available on `PATH`

To prepare the Julia environment, from the repository root run:

```bash
julia --project=src/blab/solvers/julia_cuda -e "using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"
```


GPU solving VRAM requirements scale quadratically with mesh element count. Below are estimated VRAM requirements for various element counts:

| Total Elements | Estimated VRAM |
|---:|---:|
| 1,000 | ~50-100 MB |
| 2,000 | ~200-300 MB |
| 3,000 | ~400-600 MB |
| 5,000 | ~1.0-1.5 GB |
| 7,000 | ~2.0-3.0 GB |
| 10,000 | ~4-6 GB |
| 15,000 | ~8-12 GB |
| 20,000 | ~14-20 GB |

### BEAT Engine Metal GPU Solver Requirements (Apple Silicon)

* macOS on Apple Silicon (M1 or newer)
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/) installed and available on `PATH`

To prepare the Julia environment, from the repository root run:

```bash
julia --project=src/blab/solvers/julia_metal -e "using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"
```

The Metal backend is a hybrid: field evaluation runs on the Apple GPU (Metal.jl) while the
Burton-Miller dense solve runs on the CPU through Apple's Accelerate framework (the AMX matrix
coprocessor). Because Apple Silicon uses unified memory, this path is not bound by the discrete-GPU
VRAM table above — it can address as much memory as the machine has. See
[BEAT Engine Metal](docs/advanced/beat-engine-Metal.md) for details, including which kernels still
require validation on Apple hardware.

##

### BEAT Engine CPU Solver Requirements

* Intel, AMD, or ARM CPU
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/) installed and available on `PATH`

To prepare the Julia environment, from the repository root run:

```bash
julia --project=src/blab/solvers/julia_local -e "using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"
```

##

### Bempp CPU Solver Requirements

* Intel or AMD CPU
* An OpenCL runtime

The [Intel CPU OpenCL runtime](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-cpu-runtime-for-opencl-applications-with-sycl-support.html) is a practical option even on many non-Intel systems.

##

## Application Installation

From the repository root run:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
```

## Run The GUI

```bash
blab gui
```

On startup, Boundary Lab updates `ath/ath.cfg` so Ath writes generated files into:

```text
runs/ath_output
```


## Boundary Lab Server

Boundary Lab can also run a local or LAN-accessible job server that accepts solve
jobs and streams per-frequency results back as NDJSON events:

```bash
blab server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --solver bempp_cpu
blab server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --solver beat_cpu --julia-threads auto
blab server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --solver beat_cuda
```

Supported server-side solver IDs are `bempp_cpu` for Bempp OpenCL CPU, `beat_cpu`,
`beat_cuda`, `beat_rocm`, and `beat_metal`. ROCm is accepted as a server selector but the ROCm
BEAT Engine implementation is still a placeholder and will report not implemented
until that engine path is completed. `beat_metal` targets Apple Silicon and runs a Metal GPU /
Accelerate hybrid (see [BEAT Engine Metal](docs/advanced/beat-engine-Metal.md)). For BEAT Engine solvers, use
`--julia-executable` and `--julia-threads` to point the server at the intended
Julia installation and thread count.

To use it from the GUI application, open `Edit > Preferences`, set `BEM Solver` to
`Server`, and set `Solve Server URL` to the server address. Use `Check Server` to
query `/health`; the app uses the advertised capabilities, such as mesh
symmetry support for feature availability. For another machine on the LAN, bind
the server to that machine's LAN address or `0.0.0.0` and use
`http://<server-ip>:8765` in the client. The GUI uploads the solver mesh files
with each server job, so the server does not need access to the client's local
paths.

For Docker image deployment with the BEAT Engine CUDA solver, see
[Docker](docs/Docker.md).
