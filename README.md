# Boundary Lab

<img src="assets/mainwindow.png" alt="Boundary Lab main window" width="700">

Boundary Lab is a GUI-based multiphysics acoustic simulation tool for loudspeaker design. It generates or imports loudspeaker meshes, infers exterior BEM, interior FEM, or coupled FEM-BEM-LEM solving from the configured physical system, and presents acoustic and electroacoustic results in the desktop application. Ath is bundled as a geometry-generator provider with permission from Marcel Batik.

### [Follow the official development thread on DIYAudio](https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/boundary-lab.440847/)

## Features

- Waveguide design editor with one-click geometry generation through the bundled [Ath4](https://at-horns.eu/) generator
- 3D mesh viewport for generated geometry and imported `.msh` files
- Physical-system editor for exterior BEM, interior FEM, and coupled FEM-BEM-LEM models
- Prescribed-velocity and linear electrodynamic transducer components
- Channel controls for level, polarity, delay, and HPF/LPF crossover shaping
- Live horizontal/vertical directivity, on-axis response, spinorama, excursion, maximum-SPL, and impedance plots
- Plot-image, polar-data, on-axis channel-data, and balloon-data export
- 3D balloon viewer built directly from Fibonacci-sphere solve samples
- Project save/load with readable, backward-compatible `.blab.json` files

While not required, if modeling in Autodesk Fusion, the [Fusion2Msh](https://github.com/JWSound/fusiontomsh) add-in is strongly recommended for quick imports of mesh files into Boundary Lab.

## Windows quick start

1. Double-click `01_install_update_boundary-lab.bat` in the repository folder.
2. Follow the guided prompts. The installer creates the Python environment and
   installs the BEAT Engine solver and can optionally prepare its Julia
   CPU, NVIDIA CUDA, and AMD ROCm environments.
3. If the installer adds Git, Python, or Julia, close it and run it again when
   instructed so Windows can refresh the available commands.
4. Double-click `02_start_boundary_lab.bat` to launch Boundary Lab.


## Solver Requirements

Boundary Lab uses BEAT Engine for numerical solving of exterior, interior, or coupled systems. BEAT Engine is an open-source acoustic solver platform written in Julia that is downloaded automatically as a pinned package as part of Boundary Lab. See [BEAT dependency setup](docs/BEAT%20Local%20Dependency.md) for updates and contributor overrides.

### BEAT Engine CUDA GPU Solver Requirements

* NVIDIA Maxwell-generation or newer GPU
* Latest NVIDIA Studio/Game Ready driver recommended
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/) installed and available on `PATH`

To prepare the Julia environment, from the repository root run:

```bash
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend cuda
```

### BEAT Engine ROCm GPU Solver Requirements

* AMD GPU supported by the installed ROCm/HIP SDK and operating system; check AMD's [Windows support matrix](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon-ryzen/en/latest/docs/shared/hipsdk/reference/system-requirements.html) or [Linux compatibility matrix](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.html)
* Compatible AMD GPU driver and ROCm installation (HIP SDK on Windows), including rocBLAS and rocSOLVER
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/) installed and available on `PATH`

To prepare the Julia environment, from the repository root with Boundary Lab's Python environment activated, run:

```bash
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend rocm
```

The Windows installer can detect an existing AMD SDK and prepare the ROCm environment. See [BEAT Engine AMD ROCm setup](docs/advanced/beat-engine-rocm.md) for SDK configuration and runtime verification.

### BEAT Engine Apple Metal GPU Solver Requirements

* Apple Silicon Mac (M-series)
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/) 1.12 installed and available on `PATH`

To prepare the Julia environment, from the repository root with Boundary Lab's Python environment activated, run:

```bash
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend metal
```

Select **BEAT Engine (Apple Metal)** in Preferences, or pass `--backend beat_metal` on the command line. Automatic backend selection does not choose Metal.

### BEAT Engine CPU Solver Requirements

* Intel, AMD, or ARM CPU
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/) installed and available on `PATH`

To prepare the Julia environment, from the repository root run:

```bash
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend cpu
```

##

GPU solving VRAM requirements scale quadratically with mesh element count for exterior BEM solving. Below are estimated VRAM requirements for various element counts:

| Total BEM Elements | Estimated VRAM |
|---:|---:|
| 1,000 | ~2 MB |
| 2,000 | ~8 MB |
| 3,000 | ~18 MB |
| 5,000 | ~50 MB |
| 7,000 | ~98 MB |
| 10,000 | ~200 MB |
| 15,000 | ~450 MB |
| 20,000 | ~800 MB |


## Application Installation

From the repository root run:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
```

## Run The GUI

```bash
blab gui
```

## Boundary Lab Deploy prototype

Boundary lab deploy is an interactive advanced array simulation tool that ingests .blabspeaker packages generated from the main boundary lab application. It is an experimental application early in development and currently only supports BEM/coupled solving using BEAT engine on Nvidia hardware. The application can be found inside the /deploy/ folder where a separate readme contains installation instructions.
